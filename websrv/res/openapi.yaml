        A bitmask for controlling how and if content metadata is re-imported

          - 0x01: Metadata is reliable
          - 0x02: Metadata is locked
          - 0x04: Metadata might be stale

        Unreliable: Parsed from file tags which are considered inaccurate
        and are often imprecise.

        Reliable: Reported by a decoder when opening the audio/video
        stream for reading. Nevertheless different decoders may report
        slightly differing values. Reliable metadata cannot be updated
        by unreliable metadata. Instead it could be marked as *stale* if
        a re-import is desired.

        Locked: Locked metadata will not be updated automatically, independent
        of the *reliable* flag. Neither when parsing file tags nor when decoding
        the audio/video stream. Instead it could be marked as *stale* if a
        re-import is desired.

        STALE: This flag signals that the content metadata should be
        re-imported depending on the reliability flag. Alternatively
        the *stale* flag could be reset manually.
